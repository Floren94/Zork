### Introduction

In the game there are 5 actions you can do. Move to other rooms, look around and pick, drop and use the items you find.

You can move 4 direction: north, east, south and west. To do so you will have to input "go" and the direction you want to move.

There are 4 items in the game you can get. The key to open the main door, a lance to fight the guardian, a snack to recover health and a bag to carry extra items. You can't drop or use the bag when you get it but it will increse the number of objects you can carry from 1 to 3.

You can drop the items you have anywhere you want and come back to pick them. If you are not shure wehere did you left them, you can use the command "Look" to see what objects you can find in the room you are in.

To drop or pick simply input "drop" or "pick" followed by the item name.

### Walkthrough

First of all, it's easy to get lost so here's the [MAP](Map.jpg) of the game. The start point is at Room 1, Section 1 (1.1).

Your main goal is to get the key and open the doors so you can leave. There're some things we need to be aware of if we don't want to be trapped here forever or even worse, dead. If we go all the way up and pick the key at (9.1) to open the main door using it at (8.1), we are going to face The Guardian that will block our way out with our hands. This will lead us to be inside the east wing of the mansion forever or get killed by The Guardian.

To have any chance we will have to get ourselves the lance at (4.2) to use it against The Guardian and try to kill him. We are going to get hit so it's also a good idea to pick the snack at (5.2) so we can recover our health in case thing get ugly. The fact is that we can only carry one item at a time and if we want to get out we need at least the key to open the door and the lance to face The Guardian. So basically we need to get the bag to carry all the items we can find.

### Finally, the right way to do it is:

First we go all the way south to (3.1) to get the bag. 

From here we can go north and pick the lance at (4.1).

Now we have to go to the east to (7.1) and climb up the staris to (9.1).

On that trip you can get the snack at (5.2) before you get to the second floor at (9.1) and pick the key.

After that we will head to the east side at (8.1) and use the key. This will spawn The Guardian at (5.3)

We go to meet him and type "use lance" as many times and as fast as we can. If we miss more than spected we can go east and take the snack, this will max our health and go face him again.

After killing him we can go to (5.4) and go south to complete the game.
